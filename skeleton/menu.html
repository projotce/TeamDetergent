<div class="header menu">
	<h2>header</h2>
<button type="button"><a href="index.html">exit</a></button>
<button type="button"><a href="menu.html">menu</a></button>
</div> 
<br>
<br><br><br><br>menu doesn't really have much. it'll probbaly just have a button to exit out of the menu and go home and then another button that when clicked, will also exit out of the menu
